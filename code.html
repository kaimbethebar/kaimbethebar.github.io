                <h2>NixOS Configuration</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was made for fun whenever I wasn't working on homework during my sophomore year of university.<br>
                    My reasoning for working on this project was so that I am able to make an easily reproducible system.<br>
                    This was done by making use of the NixOS distribution of Linux, as well as the Nix programming language.<br>
                    While it didn't serve a professional use, it could be used to reproduce a system with my other configurations and applications.<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Waybar Configuration</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was done for fun but also as a means of streamlining my productivity while using Wayland display mangers.<br>
                    I had to learn how to use both CSS as well as work with the Waybar system, attempting to create something clean and streamlined.<br>
                    This project also ended with me having to understand how to get it to work with external programs, such as Hyprland or Sway.<br>
                    At the end of the project, this helped me understand styling, balancing form with function, and making programs function together.<br>
