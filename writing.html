                <p>
                    The majority of writing that I have done throughout college thus far has been research in APA format.<br>
                    The most extensive of which has been has been done in my "Legal and Ethical Issues in IT" class.<br>
                    This writing consisted of looking into the Boeing 373 Max crashing, Therac, and various ethical frameworks.<br>
                    Outside of that, some other example consist of poetry, looking into psycology, and deep drives into music.

                <h2>Pixel Art</h2>
                <p>
                    Something that I have exclusively done for fun would be pixel art, specifically GameBoy style sprites.<br>
                    I have been using this as an outlet whenever there's nothing else to work on, being something somewhat productive.<br>
                    At some point i am planning on using this in conjunction with my coding knowledge to make a small, simple test game.<br>
                    Other examples of art I have done can be found at the top of the website, showing different works by mousing over the image.
